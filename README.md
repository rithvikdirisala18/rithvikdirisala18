## About Me

I’m a Computer Science student with a strong foundation in full-stack software development, artificial intelligence, and embedded systems. My work is grounded in building performant, user-centered applications and understanding the deeper architecture behind emerging AI models. I'm particularly interested in the internals of large language models (LLMs) and their real-world applications.
